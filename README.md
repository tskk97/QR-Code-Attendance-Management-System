# QR Code Attendance Management System
# Objective:
The main objective of the automated attendance system is to computerize the traditional way of recording attendance and provide an efficient and automated method to mark and track attendance in institutions.
In the proposed system we are implementing a combination of a Web application along with an Android application to track, mark and store the attendance of the students on a daily basis.
